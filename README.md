# 🦖 Dinosaur Era API

Welcome to the **Dinosaur Era API**, a public JSON-based collection of dinosaurs from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. This project is designed to provide accessible, structured data for developers, educators, and enthusiasts interested in prehistoric life.

## 🌍 Available Eras

Each era has its own JSON file containing dinosaur data. You can access them directly via [GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/dino-api/) (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username).
